          <h4>Are you currently a Dish Customer?</h4>

          <p>Advanced Communications Electronics Inc. was one of the very 1st Dish Network providers in the United States. In fact we have been in the Satellite business for so long that we used to buy DirecTV from the man who created Dish Network.</p>

          <p>...but those were the "good ole days" we no longer sell or install Dish Network due to a lack of popular channels and a list of software issues. Our Solution? <a href="#box_4">DirecTV</a>! We now swap Dish Network systems out for new DirecTV systems, call us today to take Advantage of this INCREDIBLE Offer!</p>

		  <p>Please be aware that we hope to offer Dish Network again in the future, we cannot offer it today due to a current low rate of customer satisfaction; therefore today (2015) we are offering DirecTV as the solution, if / when this changes we will off Dish Network again.... we just can't sell a product that we can't stand behind and the current version of Dish Network unfortunately falls into that category.</p>

          <h4>Can we design/build a network on the Exede service?</h4>

          <p>Exede is a highly capable and quick ISP, it's also expandable. We offer residential and commercial network solutions. Utilizing State of the Art Gigabit Switches we can design and develop a network that is highly expandable and scalable.</p>

          <p>At it's current state the Exede system is perfect for communications and entertainment, you can use a single Exede dish to wire your entire lakeside cabin with Netflix &reg;, Hulu &reg;, Pandora &reg; or many other online options. We can also wire a series of Wireless Access Points so eveyone in (and around) your "off the grid" vacation home can have access to the web!</p>

		  <p>...but don't be fooled! Although Exede is perfect for an off-the-grid outdoor retreat we also install them in the middle of the city and in neighborhoods as well as densely populated commercial parks and facilities.</p>

          <h4>Who do I call when I want to upgrade my DirecTV service?</h4>

          <p>Have you had DirecTV for awhile? Are you ready for an Upgrade? Even if we didn't perform your initial product installation you can call us to check on and schedule your upgrade. Even if there is a cost for the new equiptment (and sometimes there is) it will be worth it!</p>

          <p>Why should you upgrade? Our customers upgrade mostly for two reasons, the 1st is "Higher Definition" the new equipment now offers 1080p resolution, the 2nd reason is "Expanded Storage" the new DVR hard drives (now solid state) can store over a terra-byte of Data on them so your favorite show will always be there!</p>

		  <p>Our current number is <a href="tel:8659277777"><mark>865-927-7777</mark></a></p>
